Tutorial from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdCMftVl1v0&list=PLhIbBGhnxj5JBJOA7QC5KdbLbCQ3gA1pK&index=1

Note: Tutorial was drag and drop, but I implemented in code.

Future:
- add more levels with different brick arrangements
- brick colors mean something (ex: red takes one hit, but blue is two hits)
- add more sound effects
- music track playing
- add more power ups
- add backround image
- screens (eg. game over/menu)
